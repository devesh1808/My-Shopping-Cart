      "The HTC 10 is a beautifully crafted smartphone with a gorgeous display and an ergonomic design. This phone is the first to have optical image stabilisation for the front facing camera, which does help when shooting in low light. The phone has very snappy performance thanks to the Snapdragon 820 SoC, 4GB of RAM and 32GB of onboard storage. The USB Type-C port gets USB 3.1 Gen 1 speeds for faster data transfers. Sense UI is now leaner than ever, with many of the custom apps traded in favour of Google's native apps.",
